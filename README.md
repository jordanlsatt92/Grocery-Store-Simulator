# Grocery-Store-Simulator
The grocery store simulator is an implementation of checkout lines and customers at a grocery store. StoreDriver contains the main method which runs the simulator. StoreDriver contains multiple instantiations of the grocery store object with different probabilities that a customer will appear in line, the number of checkouts, the time duration of the simulation, and the maximum number of items a customer may have when checking out.

The GroceryStore class contains the methods to simulate a line in a grocery store.

The Customer class contains the methods and variables associated with a grocery store customer.
